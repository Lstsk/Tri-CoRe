## Introduction
Tri-CoRe is a unified application system designed to streamline course and research application processes across the Tri-Co Consortium. It aims to simplify the registration system by providing a comprehensive course catalog, course ratings, and a hub for posting and applying to research opportunities.

## Problems
The current Tri-Co course registration system is fraught with challenges, including:
- Lack of detailed information (e.g., deadlines)
- No centralized database for course and research opportunities
- Disparate systems for each college within the consortium


## Solutions
### Tri-Co Course Registration System
- **Course Catalogue**: An extensive list of courses offered across the consortium.
- **Course Rating**: A feature that allows students to rate courses, aiding in decision-making.

### Tri-Co Research Portal
- A centralized hub for research opportunities, facilitating easy posting and application for both students and professors.

## Pages Demonstration
The Tri-CoRe platform features several key pages:
- **Homepage**: The main landing page.

## Coding and Challenges
### Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET**: For server-side logic and data access via Entity Framework.
- **Next.js**: For client-side rendering, fetching data from the server, and external APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Flexible and scalable NoSQL database for storing and querying application data
- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JSON**
- **TypeScript**

### Challenges
- **Data Consistency and Integrity**: Ensuring the reliability of data across the platform.
- **Large Volume Data Management**: Efficient handling and processing of data.
- **Front-End and Back-End Integration**: Synchronizing for real-time updates and managing state and data flow.

## Future Projects
- **Course Scheduler**: A tool to organize and schedule Tri-Co courses.
- **Research Opportunities**: Encouraging professors to post research openings on Tri-CoRe.
- **Club Inc. Australia - Sydney**: A project with a placeholder description aimed at expanding Tri-CoRe's functionalities.
